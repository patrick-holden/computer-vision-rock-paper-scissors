# Computer Vision RPS
## Milestone 2
An image-recognition model built using Teachable Machine, and trained to recognise the difference between a user presenting rock, paper, scissors, or nothing to the camera.

12,000 images were used to train the model, split roughly equally into the 4 categories.

The model will be used to drive a computer-vision based game, written in Python, of rock-paper-scissors.
